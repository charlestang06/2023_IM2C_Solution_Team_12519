IM<sup>2</sup>C (International Mathematical Modelling Challenge) is an international competition on mathematical modelling. The purpose of the IM<sup>2</sup>C is to promote the
teaching of mathematical modeling and applications at all educational levels for all students. It is based on the firm belief that students and teachers 
need to experience the power of mathematics to help better understand, analyze and solve real world problems outside of mathematics itself â€“ and to do so 
in realistic contexts. The Challenge has been established in the spirit of promoting educational change.
